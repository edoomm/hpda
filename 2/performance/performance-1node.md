# Performance characteristics of a single node.
Research what the term “performance” could mean for a single computer system. Document relevant characteristics for a single computer system, i.e., a server or desktop system. Find typical (performance) values for a decent (current) computer system. Your notes should cover about 1/4-page.

In computing, computer performance is the amount of useful work accomplished by a computer system. Outside of specific contexts, computer performance is estimated in terms of accuracy, efficiency and speed of executing computer program instructions.
