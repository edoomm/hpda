# Performance characteristics of the HPDA application.
Research what the term “performance” could mean for an HPDA application. Note that there is not a single performance characteristic but multiple characteristics that are meaningful. Document why a use case is high-performance. Your notes should cover about 1/4-page.

1. [The term "performance" in an HPDA application means:](https://builtin.com/hardware/high-performance-computing-applications)
    - Optimizing: _Using two terabytes of on-demand computing power from Rescale, Trek quickly evaluated bike performance from multiple angles._ (STREAMLINED BIKES)
    - Reducing: _Azure’s capability to be situated on the cloud or hybrid cloud also reduces the strain of data workloads in comparison to on-premises solutions, subsequently reducing the chance of accidents._ (AUTONOMOUS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY)
    - Make the most of information: _It takes a lot of resources and technological savvy to gather the data that’s necessary to find answers_ (Aerospace and High-Performance Computing)
    - Amassing a lot of data: _Nearly one gigabyte of data every day that must be analyzed in real time,” according to Brian Keating, a lead on the project. “This is an intensive process that requires dozens of sophisticated tests to assure the quality of the data.”_ (Space research)
