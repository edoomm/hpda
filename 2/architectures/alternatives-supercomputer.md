Research alternatives for “supercomputer architecture” in the literature, e.g., using Google. Research two architectures and select diagrams that describe them; the architecture could be a specific supercomputer. Your notes should cover about 1/4-page.

Alternatives for supercomputers architecture can be achieved by increasing computing vertically or horizontally:
- Vertical: Building a bigger supercomputer.
- Horizontal: Using many smallers systems in parallel to create a supercomputing cluster, this is what most of the companies use, it allows to scale up bigger and faster than a monolithic supercomputer, plus it allows companies to use existing computing resources, thereby significantly reducing costs.<br>
